# MNIST Classifier with TensorFlow

## Load and Preprocess Data

This project implements a simple MNIST classifier using TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to train a neural network to achieve 99% accuracy on the MNIST dataset.

## Define Callback

A custom callback is defined to stop training when accuracy reaches 99%.

## Train the Model

The script defines a simple neural network, compiles it, and trains it for 10 epochs using the defined callback.
